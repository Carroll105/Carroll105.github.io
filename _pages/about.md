# Steven (Jinpu) Cai

I am a Ph.D. candidate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Hongyi Xin](https://gift.sjtu.edu.cn/en/faculty/40912). My research sits at the intersection of Single-cell Multi-omics, Information Geometry and Machine Learning.

I also received joint training at a hospital as a Ph.D. student at [National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases](https://www.nccd.org.cn/News/Columns/Index/1113), Fuwai Hospital, Peking Union Medical College in China, supervised by [Prof.Shengshou Hu](https://www.fuwaihospital.org/News/Articles/Index/44) and [Prof. Liang Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Chen-152). 
I also collaborated with [Prof. Jessica Jingyi Li](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/li-jessica-jingyi.html) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and University of Washington. 

Currently, I am a Research Intern at the BeOne Institute, [BeOne Medicine](https://beonemedicines.com/), advised by [Dr.Minhong Yan](https://beonemedicines.com.br/leadership/minhong-yan-ph-d/) and [Dr. Wei Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Eig3MawAAAAJ&hl=en) ，where I leverage Bioinformatics and Machine Learning to facilitate novel drug target discovery and accelerate translational research in oncology.

My work leverages [Mathematics, Statistics and AI](https://carroll105.github.io/) to uncover hidden patterns in biological data to better understand complex disease mechanisms. I aim to translate these insights into predictive models that support target discovery, therapeutic development, and precision medicine.


**I am always open to academic collaborations.** If you are interested in my research or seeking partnerships in Bio-AI, please feel free to reach out at **jinpu.cai@sjtu.edu.cn**.
